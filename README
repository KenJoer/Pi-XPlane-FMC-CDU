*** Raspberry Pi-based External FMC CDU for XPlane ***

This is the software to accompany my 737 FMC CDU project. Details of the project can be found
on my blog here: http://blog.shahada.abubakar.net/tag/737fmccdu


WARNING: 
- I'm currently in the middle of refactoring large parts of the code, so it is not functional at all as an FMC for now. 
- I will update this post when it is usable again.


BUILDING FROM SOURCE
- I suggest just using the prebuilt packages
- If you really want to build from source, hunt down the dependencies, then do a "make" followed by "make install"
 

PREBUILT PACKAGE INSTALLATION

Prebuilt .deb binaries are available for raspbian "Stretch". 
See [reference to install notes] for more details.

- Install the repository public key:
  wget -O- http://repo.shahada.abubakar.net/pubkey.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  
- Add the APT source:
  cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
  sudo wget http://repo.shahada.abubakar.net/repo.shahada.abubakar.net.sources.list
  
- Install the binaries:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install pi-xplane-fmc-cdu
  
The software can be updated to the latest version at any time by executing:
  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade


TESTING

- Two test programs are currently available:

  testFMCLED
  - This is a command line test program to test the functionality of the LEDs. 

  testFMCkeypad
  - This is a command line test program to test the functionality of the keypad.


USAGE

  - The main FMC program is not ready for use yet! Watch this space for updates.
